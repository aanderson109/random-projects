# Python Random Password Generator #
This is a random password generator that accepts user input on how many of each character they would like (numbers, special characters, uppercase/lowercase letters). Currently, it has a minimum let of 3 set.

## Coming Soon ##
I intend to go beyond the typical terminal interface and develop a GUI to make using this easier. I am unsure of if this will be in the form of a desktop app, a mobile app, or a web app (maybe all 3?). Additionally, I would like to add in a "security level" feature that will let people set their own minimums for the password generated for them.

This could develop into a larger project of an actual password manager that stores the passwords given to you but I am unsure since there is already so many of them, it would have to be a purely "do it for the experience" type project. However, I am not going to rule it out because it could be fun.
